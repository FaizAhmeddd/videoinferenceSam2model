# Segmentation of Videos with SAM-2

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook for segmenting videos using SAM-2. The notebook demonstrates how to use the SAM-2 model for video segmentation, including steps to preprocess the videos, apply the model, and visualize the results.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this notebook, you will need:
- A Google account to access Google Colab
- Basic understanding of Python and machine learning concepts

### Running the Notebook

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab by clicking [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Mc4K8tiDc_1kpmNDlPRAXFHvDKYwv8Go#scrollTo=bykHFOQwzk4h).
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run each cell.
3. Upload your video files when prompted.
4. View the segmentation results in the output cells.

### Notebook Contents

- **Introduction**: Overview of video segmentation and the SAM-2 model.
- **Setup**: Instructions for setting up the environment, including installing necessary libraries.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Steps to preprocess video files for segmentation.
- **Model Application**: Applying the SAM-2 model to segment the videos.
- **Results Visualization**: Visualizing the segmentation results.

### Example Usage

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate usage
import some_video_segmentation_library

# Load the video
video = some_video_segmentation_library.load_video('path_to_video')

# Apply SAM-2 model
segmented_video = some_video_segmentation_library.apply_sam2(video)

# Visualize the results
some_video_segmentation_library.visualize(segmented_video)
